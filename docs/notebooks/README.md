## Package Installation

### Docker

After installing Docker, simply run the `./start.sh` script to build and start the docker container. The logs should output the URL that jupyter lab can be accessed on. Copy and paste this URL into your web browser.

### Other

Install the `./requirements.txt` file in whichever kernel you are using for your jupyter lab. It is important that the package versions match, so it is advised to create a separate kernel for this project.
